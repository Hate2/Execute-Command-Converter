# Bedrock Command Converter
This is a Python script that converts Bedrock Edition commands from version 1.18 and lower to version 1.19.

## Features
The script supports the following Bedrock commands and features:

* **execute** commands
* **detect** commands
* **fill**, **summon**, and other similar commands

The script can also handle **`execute`** commands with positions other than the triple tilde (`~~~`) and can format positions for consistent spacing.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the script files.
2. Place the Bedrock command files you want to convert in the **`old`** directory.
3. Run the script by running the converter.py file. The converted files will be generated in the **`new`** directory.
4. The converted files will have the same name as the original files.
